## Development Process

-   Initialized project with Vite + React + TypeScript
-   Configured Tailwind CSS v4 with custom theme using @theme directive
-   Built component architecture following separation of concerns:
    -   **ui/**: Base presentational components without business logic
    -   **form/**: Composite components specific to the contact form
    -   **layout/**: Structural wrapper components
-   Implemented fully typed form state management with TypeScript
-   Created responsive design with mobile-first approach
-   Added smooth transitions and hover effects for better UX
-   Optimized component structure to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## Challenges and Solutions

### TypeScript Integration

**Problem**: Managing form state types across multiple components.  
**Solution**: Created centralized `form.types.ts` with `FormData` interface, ensuring type safety throughout the application.

### Component Architecture

**Problem**: Avoiding component re-creation and prop drilling.  
**Solution**: Extracted all components outside of App, passed data through props, and organized by responsibility (ui/form/layout).

### Controlled Inputs

**Problem**: Handling different input types (text, radio, checkbox, textarea) with one handler.  
**Solution**: Created unified `handleChange` function that checks input type and updates state accordingly.

### Responsive Design

**Problem**: Making form layout adapt from single column (mobile) to two columns (desktop).  
**Solution**: Used Tailwind's `sm:` breakpoint with flexbox for First/Last Name fields.

### Custom Styling with Tailwind v4

**Problem**: Implementing custom color palette and fonts in new Tailwind syntax.  
**Solution**: Used `@theme` directive in CSS with HSL color values and imported Google Fonts.

### Focus States

**Problem**: Default browser focus outlines not matching design.  
**Solution**: Implemented custom `focus:outline-none focus:border-green-600` states for all inputs.

## Future Improvements

-   Add custom form validation with error messages
-   Implement form submission to backend API
-   Add loading state during form submission
-   Include success/error toast notifications
-   Add keyboard navigation enhancements
-   Implement form field auto-save to localStorage
-   Add unit tests with Vitest and React Testing Library
-   Improve accessibility with ARIA labels and screen reader support
-   Add animation for form submission success
-   Implement form analytics tracking
